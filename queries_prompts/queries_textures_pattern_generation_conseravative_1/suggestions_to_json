 Please reformat your previous response as JSON with the following structure (only the new ideas suggested):
{"Method 1 name": {"description":Detailed description of the suggested  method, how it should work, and why it is interesting will lead to unique textures/patterns (in general, no need for code)}
"Methods 2 name":...}

Output only the JSON, no other text whatsoever.
I will take your response and put it with no error in JSON.load() any additional comments other than the JSON will result in an error.
