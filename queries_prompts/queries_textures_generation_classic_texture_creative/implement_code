Write Python script that implements the texture generation method:
**benchmark_name**.

Here is the description of this method:
**becnhmark_description**


The script should contain a function:
generate_texture(outdir,sz=512,num_samples=20)***
where:
***num_sampels*** num samples texture to generate
***outdir*** is output folder where the textures should be saved.
***sz*** size of the image across each dimension in pixels by defult 512

The output of this function should generate the  folder ***outdir*** and create ***numsamples*** images of different textures generated by the method, and  save this in ***outdir*** as .png images.


Try to make the code reasonably efficient with no more than 1-2 minutes of run time per image on a good desktop.
If consistent with the task description its preferable the  texture will be seamless and colored.

Think deeply and carefully about the problem.
Your response must be in the following format:

{
 "code": the code as described above,
 "Succeed": "yes"/"no" did you succeed in generating the code,
 "notes": any other notes
}
