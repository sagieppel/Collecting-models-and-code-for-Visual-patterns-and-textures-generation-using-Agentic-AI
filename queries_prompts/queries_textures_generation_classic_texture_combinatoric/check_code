Look carefully at the task description, the corresponding  code, and the sample outputs of the code.

And try to identify errors:

Things to notice
* Does the code look right does the task description match the code?
* Will the code generate different patterns textures for each image of the num_samples or the same image again and again?
* Are the the code actually generate textures/patterns and not completely uniform colors (or black screen).



Analyze the specific task requirements and code to identify potential issues that may arise during the task's implementation.
Note only add corrections if you identify mistakes errors bugs or significant improvement you can suggest.
I am not interested in minor improvements or insignificant issues, if you cant find significant issues avoid unnecessary changes.


Please provide your response in the format of a JSON file of the following structure:


{ "corrections": "yes"/"no" Did you find errors, problems, or significant improvements and fix the  code? If "yes," you must provide the fixed code in the code field.
  "code": If you made corrections, provide the corrected code in this field.
  "notes": Explain in plain text what issues you find and changes you made.
 }
