# Collecting-models-and-code-for-Visual-patterns-and-textures-generation-using-Agentic-AI
This code uses agentic AI to propose and implement models that generate texture and pattern images from scientific, artistic, and technical simulations (e.g., Ising model, Game of Life, Navier–Stokes, colony sims, crystal growth, weather models...). Each iteration suggests a new idea, codes it, runs/debugs it, and saves the code and images

This code use Agentic AI  to suggest and implement models that generate images of textures and visual patterns based on simulations, models and other techniques from all domains of science art and tech (for example ising model, game of life, navier stock, colonies sim, crystal growth, weather sims…) basically every iteration the pipeline suggest new idea either based on published model, or original idea implement it in code, run and debug the code to generate texture/patterns images, and save both the code and the images. 
 Over 1270  different simulation/models implemented using this method and  and 100,000 images generated by them are available  at the [SciTextures dataset](https://zenodo.org/records/17485502).

More details on the method can be found in the document:

[SciTextures: Collecting and Connecting Visual Patterns, Models, and Code Across Science and Art](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.01817)

# How to use:

## 1. Update your preferred API key at API_KEYS.py.  

​The code relies on API for major AI LVLM suppliers (GPT, Gemini, Qwen, DeepSeek, Claude, Grok...). You need to have API keys (and purchase tokens) for at least one of those (GPT-5  is recommended).

The code curent supports APIs from OpenAI, Together.AI (Qwen,DeepSeek), Grok,Gemini, and Claude. You can add other APIs to tools/ToolVisualQuestion.py.



## 2. Run pipeline, generate models/simulations and images

​


**Run_all_generators.py**

At:

 **__main__** section  set input parameters :

**model** = select model name(for example gpt-5) 

**Outputdir** = The path to the folder where the code and images will be saved. THIS has to be inside the code folder, and the path MUST be given as a relative path to the code folder (this folder will contain some of the generated scripts, which will be imported into the code in real time and run).




**query_dir** = (optional) folder with queries/prompt used to guide the model generation. You are supplied with 4 such folders, some prioritize original creative methods for texture generation, and some canonical models/textures queries. All folders that start with “queries_” contain a different set of queries that can be used for query_dir. 







The script will create a new model plus texture images, with gpt 5 it take about 10-30 minutes per model (and around 0.2-0.6 usd worth of tokens).

*** The script will generate code for pattern generation and simulation, and will run it without asking for permission it will also install packages using pip without asking permission.***

### Output structure:

The output folder will contain generated models and images (one folder per model).

The images generated by the model will appear in the “textures” subdirectory of the model. 



The script used to generate the images will appear at:

“generate.py“  in the model dir



The code can be run using the function:  

**def generate_texture(outdir: str, sz: int = 512, num_samples: int = 20):**

**outdir:** output folder where the images will be saved.

**sz:** size of each image in pixels (across a single dimension)/

**num_samples:** number of different images to generate

There is no limit on the number of images and their resolution (except time).




## Additional scripts for checking and inspecting the generated models and images 

Additional scripts for checking and inspecting the generated models and images are available at  the Checking_Testing folder.



**Checking_Testing/Auto_Check_Model_Accuracy.py**

Classify each model fidelity level (How accurately it simulates the system): 'accurate', 'good approximation', 'toy model','weak model','inspired' (these terms are explained in the script file and the paper).


**Checking_Testing/Auto_Check_Model_Errors.py**

Run another round to identify errors in the models.

Classify model error level 'Accurate', 'Minor errors', 'Major errors','Undecided'


**Checking_Testing/inspect_textures.py**

 Manual and automatic inspection of the images generated by the model, and mark models with problematic images (for example, all images are black).
